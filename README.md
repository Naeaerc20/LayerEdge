# Update

1. If you're facing errors with account registration it's because by default the code uses my ref code to register each wallet, so you must replacte it with your own referral code
2. Go to https://dashboard.layeredge.io/ - copy your referral code & replace it using "nano scripts/apis.js" on the following lines: https://prnt.sc/s3oNVtXjVOdp
